          0xBlock plans to develop a fully secure DEX that integrates all
          blockchains and supports the trade of any cryptocurrency they list.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our advanced DEX will provide new heights of flexibility via
          multi-chain technology, enabling users to trade and convert 0xB tokens
          as well as those listed on all DEX-featured blockchain. The DEX will
          initially be constructed on Avalanche then be gradually expanded to
          support multi-chain operations between Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain,
          Solana, Fantom and more blockchains.
          <br />
          <br />
          To carry out these operations, we will develop a multi-chain interface
          system based on order books and atomic swaps that enables a new
          standard in cryptocurrency pair trades and conversions. This system
          will provide a one-stop multi-chain DEX solution that eliminates the
          need to conduct parallel trades in cryptocurrencies managed on
          different DEXs.

          The business model of our advanced DEX will be based on a small
          percentage commission of a transaction fee for every trade it
          completes. Pancakeswapâ€™s estimated transaction fee revenue is
          approximately
