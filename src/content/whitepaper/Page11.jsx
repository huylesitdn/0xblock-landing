                By implementing our multi-chain DEX, we will generate additional streams of income that can be shared with 0xBlock contract owners. Implementation of our DEX will also enable contract holders to benefit additionally from its profit-sharing plan and expansion of supported blockchains, user base and volume transactions.

                <br/>
                As well as profiting from increasingly advanced project modules, 0xBlock's income from transaction fees will open a further revenue stream in the form of compounded DeFi revenue investments. Since 0xBlock already evaluates DeFi investment alternatives for users, the share of DEX revenues sent to 0xBlock's treasury will also be routed to superior investment opportunities that generate compound revenues over time.
