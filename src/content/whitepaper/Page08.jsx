          0xBlock is set to become a leading, trusted and broadly used crypto
          DeFi hedge fund, providing superior yields and daily returns for
          cryptocurrency holders via DeFi contract minting.
          <br />
          <br />
          0xBlock's state-of-the-art technological platform is based on the
          Avalanche Blockchain, which we have selected for its low cost, rapid
          transfer speeds and scalable transactional infrastructure.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our team deemed Avalanche best to support the high levels of service
          and expansion we will require in delivering unparalleled profitability
          and experience to users. We deem Avalanche to also best-suit the
          broadening of contract volume and variety needed as the 0xBlock
          platform grows.
          <br />
          <br />
          Additionally, the Avalanche blockchain guarantees faster, qualitative
          development of Solidity-compatible dApps, as well as rapid maintenance
          in supporting 0xBlockâ€™s increasing innovations. Our team is confident
          in the reliability of Avalanche as the backbone of 0xBlock operations,
          though will adapt intelligently in the future if required.
