          Allocating investment funds to a range of channels helps create a
          diverse investment portfolio that mitigates risk. Though all
          investment opportunities are closely evaluated and vetted, market
          changes from any influence may reduce an asset’s value or cause price
          volatility.
          <br />
          <br />
          To mitigate these risks, we maintain a diversified portfolio with an
          optimal risk/reward balance for our investors. The team’s extensive
          experience in crypto, DeFi and investment strategies enables us to
          provide levels of portfolio diversification and risk minimization that
          can be impossible to achieve for individual investors.
